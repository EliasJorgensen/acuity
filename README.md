This repository contains all source code and materials for the Acuity image sharing platform.
See `server` and `client` directories for specific info relating to those parts of the project.

The Acuity project consists of a Backend API that takes care of user auth, image processing, automatic image tagging and CRUD capabilities, along with a Frontend built on top of React/Redux/Rx.
Together, they create a platform that allows the user to upload images, create and edit image tags and share them with their friends.

Lots of info to come, star and watch us, so that you'll stay updated! :bowtie:
